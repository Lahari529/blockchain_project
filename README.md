#Electronic Health Records Maintenance Using Blockchain
The Electronic Health Records (EHR) Maintenance System is a blockchain-based application designed to securely store, manage, and retrieve health records in a decentralized manner using smart contracts and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).

This guide explains how to use the system, including how to interact with the decentralized application (DApp), upload and retrieve health records, and manage transactions on the blockchain

#1. Introduction
The Electronic Health Records Maintenance System ensures secure and immutable health record management through blockchain technology. It leverages Ethereum smart contracts for transaction integrity and IPFS for decentralized file storage, providing a robust solution for patient and provider interaction.

2. System Overview
2.1 Architecture
Frontend: Built using [Frontend Technology, e.g., React.js] for user interaction.
Backend: Smart contracts written in  deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
Storage: Files are stored on IPFS, a decentralized file storage system. (For this project,  is used.)
Authentication: is used for secure blockchain interaction.
